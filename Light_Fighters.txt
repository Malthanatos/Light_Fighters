Class_Names

All variables are public
Only debug functions are public

References should be in the following form for different classes:
Game_Manager GM = ...
Laser_Controller LC = ...
etc.

All physics and timing based stuff must be under FixedUpdate(), collisions should be handled in Update() (higher framerate)
Be cautious of order, FixedUpdate and Update do not guarantee any kind of order, but FixedUpdate generally guarantees very close timing

Scripts:
Player_Controller.cs:
Has References to: Game_Manager, Laser_Controller, 
WASD/Arrow for movement/aim by default
Right stick/Left stick for movement and aim for PS4 and XBox controllers
Firing is automatic by aim
Binds controller when player presses A/X
Enter/Start for pause -> signal to Game_Manager
Left shift/Left trigger for secondary fire
OnTriggerEnter for power-ups
Power-ups are passive
Health increases when hit by other players
Heath decreases according to type of damage
Collsion: minimal damage
Beams: moderate damage
Missile: instant death on direct hit, some splash damage
Boss: instant death on collision

Laser_Controller.cs: (Laser Generators are dummy objects that only have position and rotation, act as references)
Has References to: Game_Manager,
Red, Green, Blue; Yellow, Cyan, Magenta; White
Single script controlls all 7 laser generators, which are instantiated at startup
The primary laser generators are all childeren of the corresponding players, and thus follow them around at all times, rotation follows left stick
Beam pellets are generated one at a time and are fired in the direction that the generator is pointing
When signaled that two primary colors have collided, it places and activates a secondary color
The same will occur when a secondary color collides with a primary color, except with white
Any one secondary color will place and activate white when it intersects with any primary color
Secondary and white laser generators will always shoot exactly 1 pellet per collision

Laser_Pellet_Controller.cs:
Has References to: Game_Manager, Laser_Controller,
Default pellet is enemy pellet, auto deletes iteself on collision
Governs the local behavior of given pellets
Beams are pellets that are rotating spring shapes
When the laser pellets hit something they do something corresponding to the type of collision, then self destruct
Signals Laser_Controller when two colored pellets collide
Deletes when it collides with an uncolored pellet

Game_Manager.cs:
Has References to: Laser_Controller, Enemy_Generator
Governs different stages through states, include debug state setter in start menu
Governs Start and pause menu behvaior
Starts/resumes game when all or two players fire at the start icon
Scrolls background while game is running
Signals Enemy_Generator if no objects are tagged enemy (asteroids are included)
Send signal to Enemy_Generator when game starts/round ends with stage number

Enemy_Generator.cs: (basically a level controller)
Has References to: Game_Manager, 
Generates Asteroids and Enemies
A primary function takes stage number as input from Game_Manager, then starts spawning, otherwise idle
Generates different combinations of enemies in pseudo-random configurations depending on the stage
Generally, asteroids will spawn randomly (outside of the map) if they are allowed in a stage, except first stage
Each stage can allow or disallow asteroids impacting level win condition
Stage 1: Asteroids only, random colors and configuration (asteroids are hard coded here)
Stage 2: Scout swarms from the top, 3 random primary color swarms
Stage 3: More scout swarms from the top, extra enemies from the bottom at the end (7), last is random secondary color
Stage 4: Enemies swarm from all sides randomly, 3 primary swarms, 3 secondary swarms afterwards
Stage 5: Introduces a single turrent centered, random primary color
Stage 6:
...
Boss Stage: Three turrents in opposing positions (secondary colors), after defeated, generate random fighters (6 waves, 3 primary, 3 secondary),
		concentric rings around centered boss, outer ring is split into secondary colors, inner ring is random primary colors

Enemy_Controller.cs:
Has References to: Game_Manager, 
Which class governs which mechanics: scout, fighter, turrent, boss, asteroid, missile
All attacks of the same type do equal damage (damage is done in Player_Controller)
Any enemy can be any color, except boss, which is always white
Checks color of impacts to determine damage from player
All objects can be collided with
Asteroids may drop power-ups, despawn after they leave the screen
Scouts will kamakaze anything they are near, they tend to swarm, won't hit each other
Fighters will use beam attacks and tend to target colors opposite to theirs (both primary and secondary colors)
Turrents will use missiles and tend to attack anyone and do not move
Missiles will are very slow, they track their designated target and explode after a certain amount of time
Missiles can only be directly destroyed by their color
Boss will do nothing, instant death on collision
